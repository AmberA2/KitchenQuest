# KitchenQuest
This is KitchenQuest, a recipe finder web app. This is a project created by Amber Anderson, Korban Anders, Carmen Cruz, and Ivie Xue for our Web App project for Purdue University Fort Wayne, which we got the award for best project of the semester. This is the a personal copy to provide public access to the source code for potential employeers to look at.

My main contributions to the project:
- Team Lead
- Database - both creation and populating
- Webpage design layout / color scheme
- Homepage / Cooking 101 / Favorites pages
- Connecting all pages with database + getting all data needed from said database to show on most if not all pages.
- Debugging
